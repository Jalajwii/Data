            "intro": "Jalaj Chaitanya is located in ISKCON temple Kanhaiyasthan, Jharkhand. Jharkhand in various Indo-Aryan languages means “forest land”. In the ancient period, in the Mahabharata, the region was referred to as Kark Khand due to location near Kark Rekha i.e., Tropic of Cancer. The region was ruled by many empires and dynasties including Nanda, Maurya and Gupta during ancient period. The land has seen maximum number of tribal revolts during the rule of British East India Company. The state is famous for the Sohrai and Khovar painting, a mural art form practiced by women. Parasnath, Baidyanath Dham, Maa Dewri Temple and Chhinnamasta Temple are major religious places. Itkhori is a holy place for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. It is believed to be the place from where Gautama Buddha started his journey for Bodh Gaya.",
            "concept": "Kanhaiyasthan, a village located about 13 km northwest of Rajmahal along the Ganga River and approximately 30 km from Sahibganj district in Jharkhand, is named after an ISKCON temple dedicated to Lord Krishna (Kanhaiya). It holds deep spiritual significance, as it is believed that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, during his journey from Bengal to Vrindavan, had a divine vision of Lord Krishna at this very place. Visitors can still see his sacred footprints, and the Jalaj site 'Jalaj Chaitanya' carries his name. As part of ISKCON—a globally recognized religious organization—the temple also plays a vital role in promoting environmental awareness and sustainability. It houses a souvenir shop offering eco-friendly products and conducts activities such as plantation and cleanliness drives, contributing to efforts for a cleaner Ganga and the conservation of its aquatic biodiversity, including species like the Gangetic dolphin, turtles, otters, and water birds of the Ganga basin.",
